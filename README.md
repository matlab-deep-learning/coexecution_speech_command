# PyTorch and TensorFlow Co-Execution for Speech Command Recognition

## Overview
This demo focuses on running MATLAB with TensorFlow and PyTorch in co-execution mode for Signal Processing applications. The code uses a Speech Command Recognition example and it presents a few concrete options in detail, including using either of MATLAB or Python as master environment.

## Target Audience
Signal Processing engineers that use Python for designing and training Deep Learning models (with PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras) are still likely to find MATLAB very useful for tasks such as dataset curation, signal pre-processing, data synthesis, data augmentation, and feature extraction, etc.
Open source alternatives exists for those tasks and they they could be OK to use when replicating a pre-existing model or training recipe. For original technical development work however, most users find those tasks hugely easier in MATLAB.
